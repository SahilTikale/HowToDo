Requisite: You are able to boot the linux VM and reach the user login prompt.

Step 1: Boot the machine, when it prompts to select the OS distribution [normal|recovery]
	Select appropriate distribution and enter 'e'
Step 2: Once on the boot menu, look for a line that starts like "linux /boot/vmlinuz-4.... ro ...." 
	Replace the 'ro' with 'rw' and at the end append "init=/bin/bash"

Step 5: Reset the root password 'passwd root'
